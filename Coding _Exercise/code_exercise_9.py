# Coding Exercise 9.1
# Write a program that asks users to enter a password. Then, it checks if the password length is greater than 7 and returns "Great password there!".

# If the password has 7 or fewer characters, the program returns, "Your password is weak".

# Solution

password = input("Enter a new password: ")
if len(password) > 7:
    print("Great password there!")
else:
    print("Your password is weak")






# Coding Exercise 9.2
# Extend the program we built in Coding Exercise 1 by adding a new feature. The new feature should allow the program to return "Password is OK, but not too strong" when the password is exactly seven characters long.

# Solution
password = input("Enter a new password: ")
if len(password) > 7:
    print("Great password there!")
elif len(password) == 7:
    print("Password is OK, but not too strong")
else:
    print("Your password is weak")
