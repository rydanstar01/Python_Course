# Coding Exercise 10.1
# Build a percentage calculator that gets from the user the "total value" and the "value" and returns the percentage as shown below:
# Enter total value: 50
# Enter value: 20
# That is 40.0%

# The program should also print a message if the user doesn't enter a number for the "total value or for the "value":
# Enter total value: 20
# Enter value: hi
# You need to enter a number. Run the program again.

# Solution
try:
    total = int(input("Enter total value: "))
    value = int(input("Enter value: "))
    percentage = float(value)/total * 100
    print(f"That is {percentage}%")

except ValueError:
    print("You need to enter a number. Run the program again.")




# Coding Exercise 10.2
# As you might know, it is not mathematically possible to divide a number by zero. Consequently, this is also not possible in Python either -you will get a ZeroDivisionError if you try:

# >>> 20 / 0
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

# With that in mind, your task for this exercise is to extend the program you created in Exercise 1 by displaying a message to the user when they enter 0 for the "total value".
# Enter total value: 0
# Enter value: 20
# Your total value cannot be zero.

# Solution

try:
    total = int(input("Enter total value: "))
    value = int(input("Enter value: "))
    percentage = float(value)/total * 100
    print(f"That is {percentage}%")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Your total value cannot be zero.")
except ValueError:
    print("You need to enter a number. Run the program again.")
